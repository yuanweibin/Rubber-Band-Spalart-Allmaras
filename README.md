## Introduction

The Rubber Band Spalart-Allmaras (RBSA) model is a modified version of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.
It allows user freely tune the model constants without worry about the model's behavior in the channel flow and boundary flow.
The details about the RBSA model will be available in our publication.

This repository provides the source code (based on OpenFOAM) of the RBSA model.

## Usage
To compile the code and run the RBSA model in the OpenFOAM, please follow the instruction given in [this page](https://github.com/yuanweibin/SAM-model).
